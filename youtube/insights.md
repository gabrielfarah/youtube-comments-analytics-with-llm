**Major Issues with the Comments:**

* **Generic responses:** Many of the replies from the creator are generic and do not directly address the specific questions asked by commenters. For example, the reply "Hola, depende de tu perfil. Gracias por comentar, darle like al video y suscribirte al canal!!" does not provide any valuable information to the commenter who asked about the suitability of mutual funds or fixed-term deposits.

* **Incomplete or inaccurate information:** Some of the responses provide incomplete or inaccurate information. For example, the reply "Hola, los fondos de inversion pueden ser publicos o privados" is incomplete because it does not mention that private investment funds are not regulated by the SMV in Peru.

* **Lack of context:** Some of the replies lack context and are not easy to understand for viewers who have not watched the video or are not familiar with the topic being discussed. For example, the reply "\\u200b@@luisccaccya-finanzaspersonalesRey dailo es un canal de YouTube? porfavor contestame" is not clear without the context of the previous comment.

**Improvement Points for the Creator:**

* **Respond to specific questions:** The creator should try to address the specific questions asked by commenters in a more comprehensive and informative manner.

* **Provide accurate and complete information:** The creator should ensure that the information provided in the replies is accurate and complete.

* **Provide context:** When replying to comments, the creator should provide enough context so that viewers can understand the reply without having to refer to the video or other comments.

* **Consider using timestamps:** The creator could use timestamps in the video to make it easier for commenters to refer to specific points in the video when asking questions. This would help the creator provide more relevant and targeted responses.

* **Educate commenters:** The creator could use the replies to educate commenters on financial concepts and help them make informed decisions about their investments.

**Major Issues**

* **Sensationalist title:** The title of the video, "Is Tyba a Bad Investment? My Disastrous Results Revealed," is overly sensationalist and does not accurately reflect the content of the video. The video is a nuanced discussion of the ups and downs of investing in Tyba, and the title makes it sound like the results are all negative.
* **Lack of objectivity:** The video is biased towards a negative view of Tyba. The video creator, Checho Plus, focuses primarily on his own negative experiences with the platform and does not give a fair and balanced overview of the pros and cons of investing in Tyba.
* **Misleading information:** The video contains some misleading information about Tyba. For example, Checho Plus claims that Tyba has "hidden fees" that are not disclosed to investors. However, these fees are clearly outlined in Tyba's terms and conditions.
* **Lack of context:** The video does not provide enough context for viewers to understand the risks and rewards of investing in Tyba. Checho Plus does not discuss the different types of investment options available on Tyba, and he does not explain how the platform's fees compare to those of other investment platforms.

**Improvement Points**

* **Use a more neutral title:** The title of the video should be more neutral and accurately reflect the content of the video. For example, a more neutral title would be "My Tyba Investment Experience: The Pros and Cons."
* **Be more objective:** The video should be more objective and provide a fair and balanced overview of the pros and cons of investing in Tyba. Checho Plus should include both positive and negative feedback from other investors, and he should explain how his own experiences may not be representative of the experiences of all investors.
* **Provide more context:** The video should provide more context for viewers to understand the risks and rewards of investing in Tyba. Checho Plus should discuss the different types of investment options available on Tyba, and he should explain how the platform's fees compare to those of other investment platforms.
* **Be more transparent:** Checho Plus should be more transparent about his own financial interests. He should disclose whether or not he has any financial relationships with Tyba or any other investment platforms.
